What are the limits of our duty to save endangered species from extinction? **This statement raises a variety of issues about** morality, conscience, self-preservation, and economics. **On balance**, **however**, **I fundamentally agree with the notion that** humans need not make “extraordinary” efforts - at the expense of money and jobs - to ensure the preservation of any endangered species. 

**As I see it, there are two fundamental arguments for imposing on ourselves at least some responsibility to preserve endangered species**. **The first has to do culpability**. To the extent that endangerment is the result of anthropogenic events such as clear-cutting of forests or polluting of lakes, we humans have a duty to take affirmative measures to protect the species whose survival we’ve placed in jeopardy.

**The second argument is an appeal to self-preservation**. The animal kingdom is an intricate matrix of interdependent relationships, in which each species depends on many others for its survival. Severing certain relationships can set into motion a series of extinctions that ultimately might endanger our own survival as a species.

**On the other hand is a compelling arguments against placing a duty on humans to protect endangered species**. It is essentially the Darwinian argument that extinction results from the inexorable process of so-called “natural selection” in which stronger species survive while weaker ones do not. Moreover, we humans are not exempt from the process.

**In sum**, the issue of endangered-species protection is a complex one. Thus, there are no easy or certain answers. Yet it is for this very reason I agree that economic self-interest should take precedence over vague notions about moral duty when it comes to saving endangered species.
