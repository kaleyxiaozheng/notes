### ReactJS - Overview
---
* ReactJS is JS library used for building reusable UI components. 
* Using React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM. 
* React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native.
* React implements one-way reactive data flow, which is easy for data binding.

### React - Features
---
* **JSX** - JSX is JavaScript syntax extension.
* **Components** - React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component.
* **Unidirectional data flow and Flux** - React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

### React - Advantages
---
* Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
* Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
* Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger
apps.

* Note: Whenever you want to use something, you need to **import** it first. If you want to make the component usable in other parts of the app, you need to **export** it after creation and **import** it in the file where you want to use it.
