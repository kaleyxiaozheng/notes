### Spring Framework - Architecture

![alt text](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/images/spring_architecture.png)

> Core Container:
  >> The **Core** module provides the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features

  >> The **Bean** module provides BeanFactory which is a sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern.

  >> The **Context** module builds on the solid base provided by the Core and Beans modules and it is a medium to access any objects defined and configured. The ApplicationContext interface is the focal point of the Context module.

  >> The **SpEL** module provides a powerful expression language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.

> Data Access / Integration
  >> The **JDBC** module provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need to do tedious JDBC related coding.

  >> The **ORM** module provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JPA, JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis.

  >> The **OXM** module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object / XML mapping implementations for JAXBï¼Œ Castor, XMLBeans, JiBX and XStream.

  >> The Java Messaging Service **JMS** module contains features for producing and consuming messages

  >> The **Transaction** module supports programmatic and declarative transaction management for classes that implement special interfaces and for all your POJOs.

> Web
  >> The **Web** module provides basic web-orientated integration features such as multipart file-upload functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context.

  >> The **Web-MVC** module contains Spring's model-view-controller(MVC) implementation for web applications.

  >> The **Web-Socket** module provides support for WebSocket-based, two-way communication between client and server in web applications.

  >> The **Web-Portlet** module provides the MVC implementation to be used in a portlet environment and mirrors the functionality of Web-Servlet module.

> Miscellaneous
  >> The **AOP** module provides aspect-oriented programming implementation allowing you to define method-interceptors and pointcuts to cleanly decouple code that implements functionality that should be separated.

  >> The **Aspects** module provides integration with AspectJ which is again a powerful and mature aspect oriented programming (AOP) framework.

  >> The **Instrumentation** module provides class Instrumentation support and class loader implementations to be used in certain application servers.

  >> The **Messaging** module provides support for STOMP as the WebSocket sub-protocol to use in applications. It also supports an annotation programming model for routing and processing STOMP messages from WebSocket clients.

  >> The **Test** module supports the testing of Spring components with JUnit or TestNG frameworks.
