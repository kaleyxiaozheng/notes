## [Node.js tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp)


### How Node.js handles a file request:
> 1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.
> 2. Ready to handle the next request.
> 3. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.

**Node.js** eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

**Node.js** runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.
