> ReactJS is JavaScript library for building **reusable UI components**

> Lots of people use React as the `V` in MVC. React abstracts away the `DOM` from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

React Features | Description
-- | --
`JSX` | JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.
`Components` | React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.
`Unidirectional data flow and Flux` | React implements one way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

> **React Advantages**
>> * React uses virtual DOM which is JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
>> * React can be used on client and server side.
>> * Component and Data patterns improve readability which helps to maintain larger apps.
>> * React can be used with other frameworks.

> **React Limitations**
>> * React only covers view layer of the app so you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.
