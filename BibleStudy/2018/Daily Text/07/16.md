*_Who makes you different from another?-[1 Corinthians 4:7](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/4/#v46004007)_*
===

We are all imperfect humans, regardless of our nationality. So why should we feel superior to anyone else?



We should have a view like that of the apostle Paul, who admonished his fellow anointed Christians that they were no longer strangers and foreigners, but ...  **members of the household of God**. [Ephesians 2:19](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/study-bible/books/ephesians/2/#v49002019)
