**[Asset Conversion](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yii/yii_asset_conversion.htm)**

> Instead of writing CSS or JS code, developers often use extended syntax, like LESS, SCSS, Stylus for CSS and TypeScript, CoffeeScript for JS. Then they use special tools to convert these files into real CSS and JS.

> The asset manager in Yii converts assets in extended syntax into CSS and JS, automatically. When the view is rendered, it will include the CSS and JS files in the page, instead of the original assets in extended syntax.
