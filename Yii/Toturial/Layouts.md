**[Layouts](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yii/yii_layouts.htm)**

> Layouts represent the **common parts of multiple views i.e. for example, page header and footer. By default, layouts should be stored in the `views/layouts` folder.

> **Important Points**
>> 1. To make Views more manageable you should −
>>> * Divide complex views into several smaller ones.
>>> * Use layouts for common HTML sections (headers, footers, menus and so forth).
>>> * Use widgets.

>> 2. Views should −
>>> * Contain HTML and simple PHP code to format and render data.
>>> * NOT process requests.
>>> * NOT modify model properties.
>>> * NOT perform database queries.
