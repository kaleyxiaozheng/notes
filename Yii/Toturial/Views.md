**[Views](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yii/yii_views.htm)**

> Views are responsible for presenting the data to end users. In web applications, Views are just PHP script files containing HTML and PHP code.

> `<?= Html::encode($this->title) ?>` It is important to encode and/or filter the data coming from the end user in order to avoid the XSS attacks. You should always encode a plain text by calling `yii\helpers\Html::encode()` and HTML content by calling `yii\helpers\HtmlPurifier`.

> **Note** - that the javascript code inside the `Html::encode()` function is displayed as **plain text**. The same thing is for `HtmlPurifier::process()` call. 

> **Views** follow these conventions âˆ’
>> * Views, which are rendered by a controller, should be put into the `@app/views/controllerID folder`.
