**[Assets](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yii/yii_assets.htm)**

> An asset is a file (css, js, video, audio or image, etc.) that may be referenced in a web page. Yii manages assets in **asset bundles**. The purpose of an asset bundle is to have a group of related `JS` or `CSS` files in the code base and to be able to register them within a single PHP call. Asset bundles can also depend on other asset bundles.
